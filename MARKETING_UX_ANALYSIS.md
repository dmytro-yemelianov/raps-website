- **IMPACT**: Looks unprofessional, confuses users

### **2. Missing Conversion Funnels**
**FOUND ON:** All pages
- **ISSUE**: No clear path from interest → trial → adoption
- **MISSING**: Call-to-action progression, trial flows, success metrics
- **FIX NEEDED**: Create conversion pathways for different user types
