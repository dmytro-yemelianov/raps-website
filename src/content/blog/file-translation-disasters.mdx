## The Cross-Platform Translation Crisis That Makes Developers Question Their Career Choices

Picture this: You upload a 31MB STEP assembly to Onshape. You wait. And wait. No progress bar. No status update. After 30 minutes, you assume something's wrong and re-upload. Sound familiar?

### The Seven-Year Bug

Here's a real support ticket response from Onshape that should make every developer's blood boil:

*"After seven years.... Your support ticket: 'Failed to import parasolid' has been identified as a bug and we are working on it..."*

**Seven. Years.**

This isn't an edge case. Large file translation is a **cross-platform disaster** affecting every major CAD system:

### Platform-Specific Translation Nightmares

**Onshape: The Waiting Game**
- No progress indicators for translations
- 30+ minute waits with zero feedback
- Developers repeatedly delete and re-upload files thinking something's wrong
- Webhook notifications for completion events don't fire reliably

**SOLIDWORKS: Geometry Gaps Galore**
Every STEP import creates surfaces with gaps that won't form solids:
- 3D Interconnect can't heal imported geometry
- Manual repair required for every import
- 90+ minute translation times for complex assemblies
- Developers forced to handle bad data downstream

**Siemens NX: License Roulette**
JT format translations come with a special surprise:
- Separate JT translator license can expire mid-workflow
- *"Your JT translator license has expired, so you are unable to convert CATPart into JT files"*
- Batch conversion requires full NX licenses (not translator-only)
- Exponentially increases costs for automation

### The Async Polling Hell

Every platform forces developers to implement the same broken pattern:
1. Submit translation request
2. Poll for status (with no progress indication)
3. Implement exponential backoff (or hammer the server)
4. Hope webhooks work (they usually don't)
5. Handle timeout failures gracefully

### Why Current Solutions Fail

**No Progress Estimation**
- File size doesn't predict translation time
- Complexity metrics aren't exposed
- Queue position is unknown
- ETA is always "¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

**Poor Error Handling**
- Timeout errors provide no recovery path
- Partial failures leave corrupted data
- Retry logic must be implemented by every developer
- No automatic fallback to alternative formats

**Webhook Unreliability**
- Onshape: Must return exactly HTTP 200 (not 201!)
- Requires valid HTTPS certificates for local testing
- Translation completion events frequently don't fire
- No delivery guarantees or retry mechanisms

### The RAPS Advantage

While RAPS currently handles APS translation elegantly with:
- Automatic polling with smart backoff
- Progress estimation based on historical data
- Robust retry logic
- Queue management

The same patterns could revolutionize translation across:
- Onshape's Translation API
- SOLIDWORKS PDM conversions
- Teamcenter JT translations
- 3DEXPERIENCE format conversions

### Market Validation

Translation problems affect **100% of CAD API developers**:
- Every platform scores HIGH for translation issues
- Combined market represents millions of failed translations daily
- Developer hours wasted on polling and retry logic
- Business processes blocked by translation failures

### The Bottom Line

When a bug takes seven years to fix, and 90-minute translations are considered "normal," the industry desperately needs better tooling. RAPS proves that CLI tools can abstract this complexity—the opportunity to expand across platforms is massive.

### Coming Up Next

In our next article, we'll explore SDK version conflicts—where SOLIDWORKS developers must rebuild their add-ins yearly, and a single interop DLL mismatch can crash everything.
