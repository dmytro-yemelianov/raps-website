*This is Part 2 of our [ACC Pain Points series](/blog/acc-forum-analysis). We analyzed 4,295 feature requests from the ACC Ideas forum.*

---

## The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ideas mentioning bulk/batch operations | 490 |
| Total votes on these ideas | 3,860 |
| #1 most-voted idea overall | Bulk user management (344 kudos) |
| Average implementation wait time | 4+ years (and counting) |

Across every category — users, photos, documents, issues, submittals — the same request appears: **"Let us do this in bulk."**

---

## The #1 Most-Voted Request

> *"There is a major need to be able to add a new hire to many projects in ACC. Instead of wasting my time opening each project and manually adding a new user to 20 projects, we need a tool that will automate this process!"*
>
> — [Forum post](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/acc-ideas/allow-adding-a-user-s-to-multiple-projects/idi-p/12714729), April 2024

**344 kudos.** The highest-voted request in the entire forum.

But here's the kicker: this was originally submitted to BIM360 **six years ago**. When users migrated to ACC, they submitted it again. Still waiting.

## The Math of Manual Work

Let's quantify the pain. Adding a new team member to 50 projects manually:

| Step | Time | Total |
|------|------|-------|
| Navigate to project | 15 sec | — |
| Open Members panel | 5 sec | — |
| Search for user | 10 sec | — |
| Select role | 5 sec | — |
| Confirm | 5 sec | — |
| **Per project** | — | **40 sec** |
| **50 projects** | — | **33 minutes** |

And that's assuming no page load delays, no typos, no accidental wrong clicks.

For a large enterprise with 200+ projects onboarding a new BIM manager? **Over 2 hours of clicking.**

Now multiply by every new hire, every departing employee, every role change.

## Where Bulk Operations Are Missing

Our analysis found bulk operation requests across every major category:

### User Management (175 ideas, 1,677 kudos)
- Add users to multiple projects
- Remove users from multiple projects
- Update roles across projects
- Copy team members between projects

### Photos & Media (163 ideas, 1,969 kudos)
- Bulk photo editing
- Mass photo tagging
- Batch photo downloads
- Multi-photo deletion

### Documents & Files (207 ideas, 1,353 kudos)
- Bulk file uploads with metadata
- Mass document status updates
- Batch folder permission changes
- Multi-file version management

### Issues & Submittals (296 ideas, 1,607 kudos)
- Bulk issue creation from spreadsheets
- Mass status updates
- Batch assignee changes
- Bulk export to CSV/Excel

## Why This Matters for AEC

Construction projects aren't small. A typical large project might have:

- 200+ team members
- 50+ subcontractors
- 100+ folders with custom permissions
- 10,000+ documents
- 1,000+ issues

When every operation is click-by-click, administrative overhead explodes. BIM managers become full-time data entry clerks.

## The Workarounds Teams Use Today

### Option 1: Manual Labor
Assign an intern or admin to click through hundreds of operations. Expensive, error-prone, soul-crushing.

### Option 2: Desktop Tools (Naviate)
Third-party Windows applications that batch some operations. But:
- Enterprise pricing (not published)
- Windows-only
- Can't be automated in CI/CD
- Limited to specific features

### Option 3: Custom Scripts
Build your own automation using the APS API. But:
- Requires developer resources
- No standard patterns
- Every team reinvents the wheel
- Maintenance burden

### Option 4: RAPS CLI
What we built.

---

## The RAPS Approach

RAPS v4.0 introduced `raps admin` commands specifically to address bulk operations:

### Add User to All Projects

```bash
# Add new hire to all 200 projects
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "newhire@company.com" --role project_admin

# Progress tracking built-in
Adding user to projects...
[████████████████████████████████████████] 200/200
```

**Time: ~45 seconds** (vs. 2+ hours manual)

### Filter by Project Pattern

```bash
# Only add to 2024 projects
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "contractor@partner.com" \
  --role viewer --filter "^2024-"
```

### Dry-Run First

```bash
# Preview before executing
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "user@company.com" \
  --role project_admin --dry-run

Dry run results:
┌─────────────────────────────┬────────────┐
│ Project                     │ Action     │
├─────────────────────────────┼────────────┤
│ Downtown Tower              │ Would add  │
│ Hospital Wing               │ Would add  │
│ University Library          │ Would skip │
└─────────────────────────────┴────────────┘
```

### Resumable Operations

Network hiccup? Connection timeout? No problem:

```bash
# Resume from where you left off
raps admin operation resume
```

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# Automated onboarding workflow
name: User Onboarding
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      email:
        required: true

jobs:
  onboard:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Add to all projects
        run: |
          raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "$EMAIL" \
            --role project_admin
```

## Performance Comparison

| Method | 50 Projects | 200 Projects |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Manual UI | 33 minutes | 2+ hours |
| Naviate | ~10 minutes | ~30 minutes |
| RAPS CLI | **~15 seconds** | **~45 seconds** |

RAPS processes up to 50 projects in parallel with automatic rate limit handling.

---

## Beyond User Management

The same pattern applies to other bulk operations we're building:

### Coming Soon
- `raps admin issue bulk-create` — Create issues from CSV
- `raps admin photo bulk-tag` — Tag photos in bulk
- `raps admin submittal bulk-update` — Mass status changes

### Already Available
- `raps admin user add/remove/update-role`
- `raps admin folder rights`
- `raps admin project list --filter`
- `raps admin operation resume/cancel`

---

## The Broader Pattern

This isn't just about RAPS. The bulk operations gap reveals a fundamental truth about enterprise software:

**UI-first design doesn't scale.**

What works for 10 projects breaks at 100. What works for 5 team members fails at 500. ACC was designed for small-to-medium projects and is now being pushed into enterprise contexts.

The API exists. The data is accessible. The missing piece is tooling that treats bulk operations as first-class features, not afterthoughts.
