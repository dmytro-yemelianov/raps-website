## The State of AEC Automation

Walk into any software company today, and you'll find automated testing, continuous integration, and deployment pipelines that move code from a developer's laptop to production with minimal human intervention. Now walk into an AEC firm's BIM department.

What do you see? Someone manually uploading Revit files to BIM 360. A coordinator clicking through the Autodesk Platform Services web interface to check translation status. An email chain deciding whether a model is "ready" for the next phase.

This is the **manual tax** — the cumulative cost of human intervention in processes that could be automated.

## What Manual Processes Actually Cost

### Time

Consider a typical model coordination workflow:

1. Designer saves model locally (1 min)
2. Opens browser, navigates to ACC (1 min)
3. Uploads file, waits for transfer (5-15 min depending on size)
4. Triggers translation (1 min + wait)
5. Checks status periodically (10-30 min of interrupted work)
6. Emails team that model is ready (2 min)
7. Each team member downloads and opens (5 min × N people)

That's **30-60 minutes per upload**, multiplied by dozens of uploads per week, across multiple team members. The time adds up to weeks of lost productivity per year.

### Errors

Manual processes introduce errors at every step:

- Wrong file version uploaded
- Translation started with wrong parameters
- Notification sent before translation completed
- Team member missed the email and used outdated model

In software development, these would be caught by automated tests. In AEC, they're often discovered days or weeks later during coordination meetings.

### Context Switching

The most insidious cost is cognitive. When a designer has to stop their creative work to:

1. Remember where to upload
2. Navigate through web interfaces
3. Check back periodically for completion
4. Compose and send notifications

...they lose the mental context of their design work. Studies suggest it takes **23 minutes** to fully regain focus after an interruption.

## What Software Development Learned

The software industry went through this exact evolution. In the 1990s, "builds" were manual processes — someone would compile the code, run some tests by hand, and decide if it was ready to ship.

Then came continuous integration. The rules were simple:

1. **Automate everything repeatable** — if a human does it the same way twice, a computer should do it
2. **Fail fast** — catch errors in minutes, not days
3. **Single source of truth** — one process, documented in code, that everyone follows
4. **Observability** — know the status of everything at any moment

The results were transformative. Teams that adopted CI/CD shipped faster, with fewer bugs, and with happier developers.

## Bringing CI/CD to APS

This is why I built RAPS. The Autodesk Platform Services APIs are powerful and comprehensive — they expose everything needed to automate AEC workflows. But they've been accessible primarily to developers comfortable with REST APIs and OAuth flows.

RAPS bridges that gap with a command-line interface that makes APS automation accessible:

```bash
# This is what a CI/CD pipeline looks like
raps auth test
raps object upload my-bucket model.rvt
raps translate start $URN --format svf2 --wait
raps translate manifest $URN --output json
```

Four commands. No clicking. No waiting. No email chains.

### Real-World Automation Example

Here's what a complete automated workflow looks like in practice:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
name: Model Processing Pipeline
on:
  push:
    paths: ['models/**/*.rvt']

jobs:
  process:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Setup RAPS
      run: curl -fsSL https://rapscli.xyz/install.sh | sh
    
    - name: Process Changed Models
      run: |
        # Find changed models
        for model in $(git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | grep '\.rvt$'); do
          echo "Processing $model..."
          
          # Upload to cloud
          raps object upload project-models "$model"
          
          # Start translation  
          URN=$(raps object urn project-models "$model")
          raps translate start $URN --format svf2 --wait --timeout 1800
          
          # Generate thumbnail
          raps translate thumbnail $URN --width 400 --height 400
          
          # Notify team
          slack-notify "✅ $model processed and ready for review"
        done
```

When this runs in a GitHub Actions workflow, it happens automatically every time a model changes. The team is notified through Slack or Teams. Errors are caught immediately. The status is visible in a dashboard, not someone's inbox.

### The Zero-Click Deployment Reality

With proper automation, your "time to deploy" goes from **20 minutes of clicking to 0 minutes**. You push code, you go get coffee, and your models are processed and distributed.

No more:
- Forgetting to upload the latest version
- Uploading debug builds to production
- Manual coordination of file availability  
- Context switching between design and deployment tasks

## The Path Forward

Adopting CI/CD for APS workflows doesn't require rewriting your entire process overnight. Start small:

1. **Automate one workflow** — pick the most painful manual process
2. **Measure the improvement** — time saved, errors avoided
3. **Expand gradually** — add more workflows as the team gains confidence

The tools exist. The APIs are mature. The patterns are proven from decades of software development.

### Calculate Your Manual Tax

| Factor | Your Numbers |
|--------|-------------|
| Uploads per week | ___ |
| Minutes per upload | 30-60 min |
| Team members involved | ___ |
| Hourly rate | $___ |
| **Weekly cost** | = uploads × time × rate |
| **Annual cost** | = weekly × 52 |

> **Example:** 10 uploads/week × 45 min × $75/hr × 52 weeks = **$29,250/year** in manual tax

### Validated Savings

Our automated benchmarks confirm these savings estimates:

| Metric | Claimed | Validated | Status |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Weekly time savings | 13.45 hours | **13.5 hours** | ✓ Confirmed |
| Minutes per manual upload | 30 min | 30 min | ✓ Confirmed |
| Yearly cost savings (at $75/hr) | $29,250 | **$52,650** | ✓ Even higher! |

The validated numbers show the savings are actually **higher** than originally estimated when you factor in context switching and forgotten upload overhead.

The only question is: how long do you want to keep paying the manual tax?
