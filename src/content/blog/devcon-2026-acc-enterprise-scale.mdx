## The Math That Doesn't Work

There's a moment in every enterprise ACC deployment when someone realizes the math doesn't work.

You have 200 active projects. Each project needs issues tracked, submittals managed, checklists completed, RFIs answered. The project management team has 8 people. Even if each person spends just 15 minutes per project per week on administrative tasks, that's **500 hours of clicking—every week**.

This session is about breaking that math.

## The Enterprise ACC Reality

**The Setup:** A large general contractor with 200+ active construction projects. ACC is their platform of choice. Documents flow through ACC. Issues get tracked in ACC. Submittals, RFIs, checklists—all ACC.

**The Problem:** Scale breaks everything.
- The BIM team uploads 500 models per month. Each needs translation.
- The quality team creates 2,000 checklists per month from templates.
- Project controls tracks 10,000+ open issues across all projects.
- Leadership wants weekly reports aggregating data across the entire portfolio.

**The Current State:** A small army of coordinators clicking through the ACC UI, copying data into spreadsheets, manually creating issues one at a time. It's unsustainable.

**The Question:** What if we could automate 80% of this?

## Pattern 1: Issue Management at Scale

```bash
# List all issues in a project
raps issue list abc123-project-id --status open

# Create an issue programmatically
raps issue create abc123-project-id \
  --title "Structural clash at Level 3 - Grid C7" \
  --description "HVAC duct conflicts with beam B-12."

# Bulk create from CSV (clash detection export)
while IFS=, read -r title description; do
  raps issue create "$PROJECT_ID" --title "$title" --description "$description"
done < clash-report.csv
```

**Time saved:** 47 issues × 2 minutes each = 94 minutes → 10 seconds.

## Pattern 2: Submittals Workflow

```bash
# Create a new submittal
raps acc submittal create abc123-project-id \
  --title "Curtain Wall Shop Drawings - Revision 2" \
  --spec-section "08 44 00" \
  --due-date "2026-05-15"

# Project kickoff: create 120 standard submittals
while IFS=, read -r title spec_section days; do
  due_date=$(date -d "+${days} days" +%Y-%m-%d)
  raps acc submittal create "$PROJECT_ID" \
    --title "$title" --spec-section "$spec_section" --due-date "$due_date"
done < master-submittal-list.csv
```

**Time saved:** One week → 30 minutes.

## Pattern 3: Checklists at Scale

```bash
# Create checklist from template
raps acc checklist create abc123-project-id \
  --title "Level 5 MEP Rough-In Inspection" \
  --template-id template-789 \
  --location "Building A, Level 5"

# 50-story tower: create 200 inspection checklists
for floor in {1..50}; do
  for zone in "North" "South" "East" "West"; do
    raps acc checklist create "$PROJECT_ID" \
      --title "MEP Rough-In - Level $floor $zone" \
      --template-id "$TEMPLATE_ID"
  done
done
```

**Time saved:** 2 days → 5 minutes.

## Pattern 4: RFI Reporting

```bash
# Monday morning portfolio review: overdue RFIs
echo "Overdue RFIs by Project" > rfi-report.csv
for project_id in $(cat project-ids.txt); do
  overdue=$(raps rfi list "$project_id" --output json | \
    jq '[.[] | select(.status != "answered" and .due_date < now)] | length')
  echo "$project_id,$overdue" >> rfi-report.csv
done
```

The report that used to take all morning? Runs automatically at 6 AM.

## Pattern 5: Bulk User Management (NEW in v4.0)

![Bulk Operations](/blog/devcon/1259-acc-enterprise-scale-bulk-ops.png)

This one came from real pain. A client spent two full days adding a new hire to 180 projects. Click, search, assign, repeat. Their IT guy was ready to quit.

### The Problem

> "We just hired a new BIM manager who needs project admin access to all 127 active projects."

With the ACC web interface:
1. Navigate to each project
2. Open the Members panel
3. Search for the user
4. Assign the role
5. **Repeat 127 times**

That's **6-10 hours** of clicking.

### The Solution

```bash
# Add user to ALL projects as project admin
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "new.bim.manager@company.com" \
  --role project_admin

# Preview first (learned this the hard way)
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "new.bim.manager@company.com" \
  --role project_admin \
  --dry-run

# Filter to specific projects
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "new.bim.manager@company.com" \
  --role project_admin \
  --filter "^2026-"
```

**Result:** 127 projects updated in under 2 minutes.

### User Offboarding

```bash
# Remove departing employee from ALL projects
raps admin user remove "$ACCOUNT_ID" "former.employee@company.com"
```

No more discovering months later that a departed employee still has access.

## The ROI Conversation

![Time Savings](/blog/devcon/1259-acc-enterprise-scale-time-savings.png)

Let's talk numbers that matter to decision makers.

**Before automation:**
- 8 coordinators spending 20 hours/week on ACC administration
- 160 hours/week × 50 weeks = 8,000 hours/year
- At fully-loaded cost of $75/hour = **$600,000/year**

**After automation:**
- Same work done in 10% of the time
- 800 hours/year instead of 8,000
- **Savings: $540,000/year**
- Plus: data is always current, reports are always fresh

The tooling is free (open source). The implementation is measured in days, not months.

## Key Takeaways

![ACC Module Coverage](/blog/devcon/1259-acc-enterprise-scale-acc-modules.png)

1. **Manual doesn't scale**—at enterprise volume, clicking is not a strategy
2. **Comprehensive ACC API coverage**: Issues, Submittals, Checklists, RFIs, Assets, and Account Admin
3. **Bulk user management** transforms 6-10 hours of clicking into 2 minutes
4. **Multiple output formats** (JSON, CSV, YAML) enable integration with any system
5. **Parallel operations** dramatically reduce processing time
6. **Resumable operations** mean network issues don't restart your 200-project operation
7. **The patterns are reusable**—what works on one project works on 200 projects

## What's Next?

Start with quick wins:
- **Quick win:** Export all open issues to CSV for your next project review
- **Medium effort:** Automate weekly reporting across your portfolio
- **High impact:** Use bulk user management for onboarding/offboarding
- **Strategic investment:** Build pipelines that create standardized project setups

Start small. Prove value. Scale up.
