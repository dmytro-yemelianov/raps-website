## What's New in RAPS 4.0

RAPS 4.0 introduces a major new capability: **bulk account administration** for Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) and BIM 360 accounts. If you've ever needed to onboard a new team member to 50+ projects, or offboard a departing employee from your entire project portfolio, you know the pain of clicking through the UI one project at a time.

Now you can do it in a single command.

```bash
# Add user to all projects
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "new.hire@company.com" --role project_admin

# Remove departing employee from all projects
raps admin user remove "$ACCOUNT_ID" "former@company.com"
```

## The Problem We're Solving

Consider this common scenario:

> "We just hired a new BIM manager who needs project admin access to all 127 active projects."

With the ACC web interface, you'd need to:
1. Navigate to each project
2. Open the Members panel
3. Search for the user
4. Assign the role
5. Repeat 127 times

That's roughly **3-5 minutes per project**, or **6-10 hours** of clicking. And if you make a mistake? Start over.

With RAPS 4.0:

```bash
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "new.bim.manager@company.com" \
  --role project_admin \
  --filter "^Active-" \
  --dry-run  # Preview first!
```

The entire operation completes in **under 2 minutes** with full progress tracking.

## Key Features

### 1. Parallel Processing (50 concurrent requests)

RAPS processes up to 50 projects simultaneously while respecting Autodesk's rate limits:

```
Adding user to projects...
[████████████████████████████████████████] 127/127

Results:
┌──────────────┬───────┐
│ Status       │ Count │
├──────────────┼───────┤
│ Succeeded    │ 125   │
│ Skipped      │ 2     │
└──────────────┴───────┘
```

### 2. Smart Retry with Exponential Backoff

Hit a rate limit? RAPS automatically backs off and retries:

```
[45/127] Rate limited, waiting 2s before retry...
[45/127] Retry 1/3 for project-xyz
[45/127] Success after retry
```

### 3. Resumable Operations

Network hiccup? Connection timeout? No problem. RAPS saves operation state automatically:

```bash
# Resume from where you left off
raps admin operation resume
```

### 4. Dry-Run Mode

Preview exactly what will happen before executing:

```bash
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "user@company.com" \
  --role viewer --dry-run

Dry run results:
┌─────────────────────────────┬────────────┐
│ Project                     │ Action     │
├─────────────────────────────┼────────────┤
│ Downtown Tower              │ Would add  │
│ Hospital Wing               │ Would add  │
│ University Library          │ Would skip │
└─────────────────────────────┴────────────┘
```

### 5. Project Filtering

Target specific projects with regex patterns:

```bash
# Only 2024 projects
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "user@company.com" \
  --role viewer --filter "^2024-"

# Multiple patterns
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "user@company.com" \
  --role viewer --filter "Downtown|Hospital|University"
```

### Contractor Onboarding

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# onboard-contractor.sh

ACCOUNT_ID="your-account-id"
EMAIL="contractor@partner.com"
PROJECT_FILTER="^2024-Active"

# 1. Add to filtered projects as viewer
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "$EMAIL" \
  --role viewer --filter "$PROJECT_FILTER"

# 2. Grant edit access to Project Files
raps admin folder rights "$ACCOUNT_ID" "$EMAIL" \
  --permission edit --folder project_files \
  --filter "$PROJECT_FILTER"

echo "Contractor onboarded to $(raps admin project list "$ACCOUNT_ID" --filter "$PROJECT_FILTER" | wc -l) projects"
```

### Monthly Access Review

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# access-review.sh

ACCOUNT_ID="your-account-id"

# Export all projects with user counts
raps admin project list "$ACCOUNT_ID" --output json > projects.json

# For each project, export users
for project_id in $(jq -r '.[].id' projects.json); do
  raps acc project-user list "$project_id" --output json >> users.jsonl
done

# Generate report
echo "Access Review Report - $(date)" > report.md
echo "Total projects: $(jq length projects.json)" >> report.md
```

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
name: User Offboarding

  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      email:
        description: 'Email to offboard'
        required: true

jobs:
  offboard:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install RAPS
        run: cargo install raps

      - name: Remove user from all projects
        env:
          APS_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.APS_CLIENT_ID }}
          APS_CLIENT_SECRET: ${{ secrets.APS_CLIENT_SECRET }}
        run: |
          raps admin user remove "${{ secrets.ACCOUNT_ID }}" \
            "${{ github.event.inputs.email }}" \
            --output json > result.json

      - name: Upload audit log
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: offboarding-audit
          path: result.json
```

## Architecture

RAPS 4.0 introduces a new `raps-admin` crate that orchestrates bulk operations:

- **State Persistence**: Operations are saved to disk, enabling resume after failures
- **Concurrency Control**: Semaphore-based limiting to 50 parallel requests
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for rate limit handling (429 errors)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars with indicatif

The crate integrates with the existing `raps-acc` module for ACC API access and adds a new `FolderPermissionsClient` for folder-level permission management.

## Upgrade Notes

RAPS 4.0 is backwards compatible with 3.x commands. The new `admin` subcommand is additive.

```bash
# Upgrade
cargo install raps --force

# Verify
raps --version
# raps 4.0.0
```

## What's Next

We're planning to add:
- **Template-based operations**: Define onboarding/offboarding templates
- **Audit logging**: Detailed logs of all admin operations
- **Rollback support**: Undo recent operations
- **Scheduled operations**: Time-based user management
