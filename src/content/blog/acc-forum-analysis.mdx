**TL;DR:** We scraped and analyzed 4,295 ideas from Autodesk Construction Cloud's official feedback forum. Only 1.4% have been implemented. The #1 most-voted request has been ignored for 6+ years. Here's the full breakdown.

---

## The Data

Between December 2021 and January 2026, Autodesk Construction Cloud users submitted **4,295 feature requests** to the official ACC Ideas forum. These aren't random complaints — they're structured proposals with voting, discussion threads, and official status tracking.

We collected every single one.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total ideas submitted | 4,295 |
| Total community votes (kudos) | 24,615 |
| Total views | 1,098,872 |
| Date range | Dec 2021 – Jan 2026 |

The question we wanted to answer: **What happens to user feedback?**

## The 96.6% Problem

Here's the status distribution:

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Gathering Support | 4,149 | **96.6%** |
| Implemented | 60 | 1.4% |
| Accepted | 37 | 0.9% |
| Under Review | 30 | 0.7% |
| Future Consideration | 18 | 0.4% |

Let that sink in. **96.6% of all feature requests sit in "Gathering Support" indefinitely.** This status means: acknowledged, but not being worked on, with no timeline or commitment.

Only 60 ideas — 1.4% — have actually shipped.

---

## The Oldest Wounds

Some high-voted requests have been waiting for years:

### #1: "Allow adding users to MULTIPLE PROJECTS" — 344 kudos

> *"There is a major need to be able to add a new hire to many projects in ACC. Instead of wasting my time opening each project and manually adding a new user to 20 projects, we need a tool that will automate this process!"*

This request was **originally submitted to BIM360 SIX YEARS AGO**. It was marked "Under Review" two weeks after submission. Zero response since.

Current status: **Future Consideration** (since April 2024)

### #2: "ACC Markups need improving" — 246 kudos, 77 replies

> *"The markups in Autodesk Docs are terrible. BIM 360 Docs Markups are far superior. Put simply, we need BIM 360 Markups in Autodesk Docs."*

Submitted: **December 2021** — over 4 years ago.

Current status: **Future Consideration**

### #3: "Remove Inherited Permissions" — 175 kudos

> *"I would like the ability to control permissions on sub folders outside of what is inherited. For example, I give everyone EDIT access at the Project Files level, but we have some folders deep inside the project we want to remove full access and only VIEW access. Currently we cannot do this."*

A basic permission management feature requested in December 2023. Still waiting.

## What Users Actually Want

We categorized all 4,295 ideas by topic. Here's where the pain concentrates:

| Category | Ideas | Total Kudos | Avg Kudos/Idea |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Documents & Files | 1,697 | 10,960 | 6.5 |
| User Management & Permissions | 1,505 | 10,368 | 6.9 |
| Viewer & 3D | 1,583 | 10,222 | 6.5 |
| Submittals & RFIs | 992 | 5,900 | 5.9 |
| Photos & Media | 311 | 2,844 | **9.1** |

**Photos & Media** has the highest average engagement per idea (9.1 kudos) despite fewer total submissions. This suggests intense, focused frustration:

- No folder organization for photos (131 kudos)
- No permission controls for photos (100 kudos)
- No bulk editing (92 kudos)

These are basic features users desperately want.

---

## The Bulk Operations Gap

We identified a pattern: **bulk/batch operations** appear across every category.

| Pain Pattern | Ideas | Kudos |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| Missing features (general) | 1,068 | 6,622 |
| UX/workflow friction | 634 | 4,793 |
| **Bulk/batch operations** | 490 | 3,860 |
| Permissions complexity | 504 | 3,251 |
| Export limitations | 420 | 2,480 |

Users want to:
- Add users to multiple projects at once
- Edit multiple photos simultaneously
- Export permissions across folders
- Bulk update issues, submittals, RFIs

ACC forces everything to be done one-by-one.

---

## The 2025 Explosion

Submission volume has grown dramatically:

| Year | Ideas | Growth |
|------|-------|--------|
| 2023 | 35 | — |
| 2024 | 733 | 20x |
| 2025 | 3,400 | **4.6x** |

3,400 ideas in 2025 alone. Either ACC adoption is exploding, user frustration is peaking, or both.

---

## International Signal: Japan

We noticed 59 Japanese-language submissions, with 23 appearing on a single day (September 30, 2025). This suggests organized feedback campaigns from Japanese construction firms — a signal that ACC is expanding into enterprise markets with enterprise-scale requirements.

Sample requests (translated):
- Free entry fields per form question
- Auto-save for photos
- Enhanced search functionality
- Faster issue status updates

---

## What Actually Gets Implemented?

Of the 60 implemented ideas, the highest-voted was:

**"Measure coordinate XYZ in 3D view"** — 276 kudos

This took years to ship. Other implementations:
- View all projects a user is assigned to (91 kudos)
- Export permissions overview (68 kudos)
- Scrollable PDFs (61 kudos)

Notice these are relatively small quality-of-life improvements, not the structural changes users request most.

---

## The Competitive Landscape

Third-party tools like [Naviate Cloud Manager](https://www.naviate.com/naviate-for-acc/naviate-cloud-manager/) have emerged to fill gaps — specifically bulk user management and project creation.

But Naviate:
- Requires enterprise licensing (no public pricing)
- Is Windows desktop-only (300MB+ installer)
- Covers projects + members, but not photos, permissions auditing, submittals, or document metadata
- Can't be scripted or integrated into CI/CD pipelines

The gap remains wide open for developer-focused tooling.

---

## What This Means for Developers

If you're building on APS/ACC, this data suggests:

1. **Don't wait for Autodesk** — high-priority requests languish for years
2. **API automation is underserved** — 145 ideas explicitly request programmatic access
3. **Bulk operations = instant value** — any tool that batches ACC operations solves real pain
4. **Permission management is broken** — auditing and inheritance controls are desperately needed

---

## The RAPS Solution

We built [RAPS CLI](/docs/introduction) to solve some of these problems programmatically. Where ACC's UI forces click-by-click workflows, RAPS lets you script it:

```bash
# The #1 most-voted request: Add user to multiple projects
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "newuser@company.com" --role project_admin

# Preview first with dry-run
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "newuser@company.com" --role project_admin --dry-run

# Filter to specific projects
raps admin user add "$ACCOUNT_ID" "newuser@company.com" \
  --role project_admin --filter "^2024-Active"
```

The new `raps admin` commands in v4.0 directly address the #1 most-voted request — bulk user management across projects. What takes hours clicking through the ACC UI now takes seconds.

---

## Methodology

**Data collection:** We scraped the ACC Ideas forum (`forums.autodesk.com/t5/acc-ideas/`) in January 2026 using the Khoros API, collecting all publicly visible ideas with metadata (title, body, kudos, views, replies, status, dates).

**Analysis:** Python (pandas) for categorization and statistics. Topic classification used keyword matching against 18 category groups.

**Limitations:**
- Only public forum data (no internal Autodesk metrics)
- Keyword categorization may misclassify edge cases
- "Gathering Support" may include ideas Autodesk is tracking internally

---

## Conclusion

The ACC Ideas forum is where feature requests go to die. With a 96.6% abandonment rate and top requests ignored for 6+ years, users have learned that feedback rarely translates to product changes.

This isn't necessarily malice — large enterprises struggle to prioritize thousands of competing demands. But the data reveals a systematic gap between what users need and what Autodesk delivers.

For developers and power users, the practical response is: **build or buy workarounds**. The API exists. The pain points are documented. The only question is who fills the vacuum.
