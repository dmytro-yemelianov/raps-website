## The Annual Ritual of Breaking Changes That Costs Millions in Developer Hours

Welcome to the special hell reserved for CAD API developers, where your perfectly working code from last year is guaranteed to break this year. Not because you did anything wrong, but because SDK versioning in the CAD world follows the "break everything annually" philosophy.

### SOLIDWORKS: The Interop DLL Nightmare Champion

SOLIDWORKS takes the crown for version compatibility disasters. Here's what developers face:

**The Annual Breaking Change Ritual**
- Every major version breaks interop DLLs
- Add-ins must be rebuilt for each release
- Running multiple SOLIDWORKS versions? Prepare for path management hell

**Real Error Messages That Haunt Developers:**
```
Error CS1705 Assembly 'AngelSix.SolidDna' uses 
'SolidWorks.Interop.swpublished, Version=26.0.1.1' 
which has a higher version than the referenced assembly
```

**The VBA 7.1 Apocalypse**
SOLIDWORKS 2021 SP2 introduced VBA 7.1, instantly breaking every existing macro:
- Earlier Installation Managers don't recognize VBA 7.1 components
- Macros written pre-2021 simply stop working
- No backward compatibility
- No migration tools

### PTC Creo: Visual Studio Dependency Roulette

Creo Toolkit adds its own special flavor of version hell:
- Must recompile for **each Creo version**
- Toolkit libraries have Visual Studio version dependencies
- "Always forward compatible but never backward"
- The GCRI plugin for backward compatibility? Dropped at Creo 7

One developer's summary: "If you're on Creo 8, you can't open Creo 9 files. Period."

### Siemens NX: The Six-Month Breaking Change Cycle

While others break annually, NX innovates with **six-month functional releases**:
- "NX Open functionality may change"
- "New prerequisites may be needed"
- Critical bugs require community-maintained patches
- GitHub repos exist specifically to fix Teamcenter 12.2 SOA crashes

### The Hidden Costs

**Developer Time Tax**
- 2-3 weeks annually rebuilding for new versions
- Testing across multiple versions
- Maintaining separate codebases
- Documentation updates for version-specific quirks

**Enterprise Deployment Nightmares**
- Can't upgrade until all add-ins are rebuilt
- Different departments on different versions
- Integration failures between version-mismatched systems
- Testing matrix grows exponentially

### The IModelDoc2 Interface: 700+ Members of Confusion

SOLIDWORKS's `IModelDoc2` perfectly exemplifies the problem:
- Over 700 members split across extension objects
- "No real logic in the separation"
- Documentation doesn't mention the split
- Version changes shuffle members randomly

### Why This Validates RAPS's Approach

RAPS's architecture anticipates version conflicts:
- Workspace crates allow version-specific implementations
- Plugin system enables version-specific handlers
- CLI abstraction shields users from API changes
- Single binary works across multiple APS versions

### The Market Reality

| Platform | Breaking Change Frequency | Developer Impact |
|----------|---------------------------|------------------|
| SOLIDWORKS | Annual (100% breaking) | Rebuild everything |
| Creo | Per major version | Full recompilation |
| NX Open | 6 months | Continuous updates |
| Revit/APS | Annual (partial) | Selective updates |

### The Billion-Dollar Opportunity

Consider the math:
- 100,000+ CAD API developers globally
- 2-3 weeks annually on version updates
- $150/hour average developer cost
- = **$600M+ in annual version compatibility costs**

A tool that abstracts version differences could capture significant value from this waste.

### Competitive Intelligence

**Worst Offenders:**
1. SOLIDWORKS - Complete interop breaks annually
2. NX Open - Fastest breaking change cycle (6 months)
3. Creo - No backward compatibility by design

**Best (Least Worst):**
- Onshape - REST API provides more stability
- Cloud platforms - Can version endpoints separately

### The Path Forward

Version compatibility tools should:
1. Detect SDK/interop mismatches before runtime
2. Provide compatibility matrices
3. Suggest specific version combinations
4. Abstract API changes behind stable interfaces
5. Maintain backward compatibility layers

### What's Next?

Our next article dives into documentation disasters—where Windchill developers beg for "Hello World" examples, and NX documentation isn't even installed by default.
