## Commands Overview

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `raps reality list` | List photoscenes |
| `raps reality create` | Create a new photoscene |
| `raps reality upload` | Upload photos to a photoscene |
| `raps reality process` | Start processing a photoscene |
| `raps reality status` | Check photoscene progress |
| `raps reality result` | Get result (download link) |
| `raps reality formats` | List available output formats |
| `raps reality delete` | Delete a photoscene |

---

## raps reality create

Create a new photoscene for processing.

```bash
raps reality create [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `-n, --name <NAME>` — Photoscene name
- `-s, --scene-type <TYPE>` — Scene type: `aerial` or `object`
- `-f, --format <FORMAT>` — Output format: `rcm`, `rcs`, `obj`, `fbx`, `ortho`

**Example:**

```bash
$ raps reality create -n "Foundation Survey" -f obj
$ raps reality create -n "Site Aerial" -s aerial -f rcm
```

---

## raps reality upload

Upload photos to an existing photoscene.

```bash
raps reality upload <PHOTOSCENE_ID> <FILE>...
```

**Example:**

```bash
$ raps reality upload abc123 ./photos/photo1.jpg ./photos/photo2.jpg
```

---

## raps reality process

Start processing a photoscene after uploading all photos.

```bash
raps reality process <PHOTOSCENE_ID>
```

---

## raps reality status

Check the processing progress of a photoscene.

```bash
raps reality status <PHOTOSCENE_ID>
```

---

## raps reality result

Get the download link for processed results.

```bash
raps reality result <PHOTOSCENE_ID>
```

---

## raps reality formats

List all available output formats.

```bash
raps reality formats
```

---

## raps reality delete

Delete a photoscene and its data.

```bash
raps reality delete <PHOTOSCENE_ID> [--yes]
```

---

## Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. List available output formats
raps reality formats

# 2. Create a photoscene
raps reality create -n "Foundation Survey" -f obj

# 3. Upload photos
raps reality upload <photoscene-id> ./photos/*.jpg

# 4. Start processing
raps reality process <photoscene-id>

# 5. Check status (poll until complete)
raps reality status <photoscene-id>

# 6. Download result
raps reality result <photoscene-id>

# 7. Clean up
raps reality delete <photoscene-id> --yes
```
