# Welcome to RAPS

**RAPS** (Rust APS CLI) is a powerful command-line tool for interacting with Autodesk Platform Services (APS). It provides easy access to all major APS APIs including authentication, object storage, model translation, data management, webhooks, design automation, and more.

## Why RAPS?

- **🦀 Written in Rust** — Fast, reliable, and memory-safe
- **⚡ Built for CI/CD** — Standardized exit codes, JSON/YAML output, non-interactive mode
- **🔐 Secure** — OS keychain storage by default, automatic token refresh, secure plugin system
- **🚀 Interactive Shell** — TAB completion, parameter hints, command history
- **🤖 AI-Ready** — MCP server for AI assistant integration
- **📦 Single Binary** — No dependencies, easy installation
- **🏗️ ACC Extended** — Issues, RFIs, Assets, Submittals, Checklists support

## Usage Modes

RAPS offers multiple ways to interact with APS — choose the mode that fits your workflow:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **[CLI](/docs/usage-modes#cli-mode)** | Standard command-line interface | Scripts, automation, CI/CD |
| **[Interactive Shell](/docs/usage-modes#interactive-shell)** | REPL with TAB completion | Learning, exploration |
| **[Python Bindings](/docs/python-bindings)** | Native Python library | Python apps, data pipelines |
| **[GitHub Actions](/docs/usage-modes#github-actions)** | Pre-built CI/CD action | GitHub workflows |
| **[Docker](/docs/usage-modes#docker)** | Containerized RAPS | Isolated environments |
| **[MCP Server](/docs/usage-modes#mcp-server)** | AI assistant integration | Claude, Cursor |

📖 See [Usage Modes](/docs/usage-modes) for detailed comparison and setup guides.

## Architecture

RAPS follows a **microkernel architecture** that separates core functionality from extended features:

- **Kernel**: Minimal trusted foundation (Auth, HTTP client, Configuration, Error handling)
- **Service Crates**: Independent modules for APS APIs (OSS, Derivative, Data Management, Design Automation, ACC, Webhooks, Reality Capture)
- **Application Layer**: User interfaces (CLI, MCP Server, TUI) and extended features

See the [Architecture Guide](/docs/architecture) for detailed information.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install RAPS CLI (choose one)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmytro-yemelianov/raps/main/install.sh | bash  # Linux/macOS
pip install raps                          # Python (CLI binary)
npm install -g @dmytro-yemelianov/raps-cli # Node.js
brew install dmytro-yemelianov/raps/raps  # Homebrew

# Or install Python bindings for programmatic use
pip install raps-bindings

# Configure credentials
export APS_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
export APS_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"

# Test authentication
raps auth test

# Start using commands!
