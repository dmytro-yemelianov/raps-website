# MCP Server: Talk to Your Model

The `raps serve` command starts a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling AI assistants to interact with Autodesk Platform Services through natural language.

> **New in v3.0.0** — The MCP server is a major feature addition.
> **Expanded in v4.1.0** — Now with 37 tools including native auth support, admin bulk operations, issues, RFIs, and ACC extended features.
> **Improved in v4.1.1** — Server starts without credentials and provides interactive setup guidance.

## From "Chat with PDF" to "Chat with Tools"

We are moving past the era of "Chat with PDF." The next frontier is **Chat with Tools**.

If you have ever tried to paste a 500MB JSON metadata extract from a Revit model into ChatGPT, you know the pain: "Message too long." RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) helps, but it is static. It can't query the current state of a model or trigger an action.

Enter the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard that allows AI assistants to use external tools. Instead of dumping data into the context window, the LLM has access to a live toolkit.

With RAPS MCP server, you can ask your AI assistant to:

- Find specific BIM elements by properties ("all 'Basic Wall' instances over 100m²")
- Create and manage buckets dynamically
- Upload files and start translations
- Browse BIM 360/ACC projects in real-time
- Check translation status and retrieve results
- Query live model metadata without size limits
- **Bulk manage users** across multiple ACC/BIM 360 projects
- **Track and manage issues** in construction projects
- **Query RFIs, assets, submittals, and checklists**
- **Navigate folders and items** with full permission control

This bridges the gap between the rigid, complex data structures of BIM and the natural language interface of AI.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the MCP server
raps serve
```

The server runs in stdio mode, listening for MCP requests from AI assistants.

**No credentials required to start.** The server starts even without APS credentials configured. When you ask your AI assistant about authentication status, it will provide step-by-step setup instructions. This means you can add RAPS to your AI assistant first, then get guided through the setup process interactively.

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude configuration file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
**Linux:** `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Minimal setup (get guided later):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "raps": {
      "command": "raps",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

After adding this, restart Claude and ask "What's my auth status?" — RAPS will guide you through credential setup.

**Full setup (with credentials):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "raps": {
      "command": "raps",
      "args": ["serve"],
      "env": {
        "APS_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "APS_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor IDE

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "raps": {
      "command": "raps",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Cursor uses environment variables from your shell, so ensure `APS_CLIENT_ID` and `APS_CLIENT_SECRET` are set.

## How It Works: Live Tool Execution

Instead of dumping data into the context window, the LLM has access to a toolkit. When you ask a question, the flow looks like this:

1. **You:** "Find all 'Basic Wall' instances in the 'Hospital.rvt' file that are over 100m²."
2. **LLM:** *Thinking... I need to inspect the model metadata.*
3. **LLM (Action):** Calls `raps model:query --file Hospital.rvt --category Walls`
4. **RAPS:** Returns a filtered JSON snippet.
5. **LLM (Response):** "I found 12 walls matching your criteria. Here are their IDs..."

You don't need to write SQL or complex filter queries. You just ask. The AI translates your natural language into the appropriate RAPS commands.

## Example Conversations

### First-time setup (no credentials)

> **You:** What's my authentication status?

> **AI:** Let me check your authentication status.
>
> **Setup Required**
>
> No APS credentials are configured yet. Here's how to get started:
>
> 1. Go to https://aps.autodesk.com and create a free account
> 2. Create a new application to get your Client ID and Secret
> 3. Add credentials to your MCP configuration:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "mcpServers": {
>     "raps": {
>       "command": "raps",
>       "args": ["serve"],
>       "env": {
>         "APS_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",

>   }
> }
> ```
>
> After adding credentials, restart your AI assistant to apply the changes.

### Checking authentication status (with credentials)

> **You:** What's my current authentication status?

> **AI:** Let me check your authentication status.
>
> Authentication Status:
> - 2-legged OAuth: ✓ Valid
> - 3-legged OAuth: Not logged in
>
> Tool Availability:
> - ✓ OSS (bucket_*, object_*) - available
> - ✓ Derivative (translate_*) - available
> - ✗ Data Management (hub_*, project_*) - requires 3-legged auth
>
> To access BIM 360/ACC data, you need to log in with your Autodesk account. Run `raps auth login` in your terminal.

### Creating a bucket

> **You:** Create a new persistent bucket in the US region called "my-project-files"

> **AI:** I'll create that bucket for you.
> 
> ✓ Created bucket 'my-project-files' with persistent retention in US region.

### Checking buckets

> **You:** What buckets do I have access to?

> **AI:** Let me check your accessible buckets.
> 
> You have 3 buckets:
> - my-project-files (persistent, US)
> - temp-uploads (transient, US)
> - eu-data (persistent, EMEA)

### Advanced model querying

> **You:** Find all steel beams in the hospital model that are longer than 10 meters and show me their material properties

> **AI:** Let me query the model metadata for you.

> - RFI-015: "MEP coordination at Level 5" (Due: Jan 22)
> - RFI-018: "Curtain wall detail at entrance" (Due: Jan 25)
>
> Would you like details on any of these?

## Architecture

The MCP server reuses all existing RAPS API clients:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│   AI Assistant  │────▶│  RAPS MCP Server │
│  (Claude, etc.) │◀────│   raps serve     │
└─────────────────┘     └────────┬─────────┘
                                 │
     ┌───────────┬───────────┬───┴───┬───────────┬───────────┐
     │           │           │       │           │           │

     │           │           │        │         │            │
     └───────────┴───────────┴────┬───┴─────────┴────────────┘
                                  │
                           ┌──────▼──────┐
                           │   APS APIs  │
                           └─────────────┘
```

The Admin and ACC clients are created on-demand for each request to support bulk operations and project-specific APIs.

## Limitations

- **No file uploads:** MCP currently doesn't support binary file transfer. Use CLI for uploads.
- **3-legged auth requires CLI:** While MCP tools can check auth status and provide guidance, the actual 3-legged login must be done via `raps auth login` in a terminal with browser access.
- **Stdio transport:** Server must be started by the AI client, not as a daemon.

## Debugging

Enable verbose logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug raps serve
```

Check server connectivity:

```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{},"id":1}' | raps serve
```
