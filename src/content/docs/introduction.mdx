# Welcome to RAPS

**RAPS** (Rust APS CLI) is a powerful command-line tool for interacting with Autodesk Platform Services (APS). It provides easy access to all major APS APIs including authentication, object storage, model translation, data management, webhooks, design automation, and more.

## Why RAPS?

- **🦀 Written in Rust** — Fast, reliable, and memory-safe
- **⚡ Built for CI/CD** — Standardized exit codes, JSON/YAML output, non-interactive mode
- **🔐 Secure** — OS keychain storage by default, automatic token refresh, secure plugin system
- **🚀 Interactive Shell** — TAB completion, parameter hints, command history (v3.8.0+)
- **🤖 AI-Ready** — MCP server for AI assistant integration (v3.0.0+)
- **📦 Single Binary** — No dependencies, easy installation

## Usage Modes

RAPS offers multiple ways to interact with APS — choose the mode that fits your workflow:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **[CLI](/docs/usage-modes#cli-mode)** | Standard command-line interface | Scripts, automation, CI/CD |
| **[Interactive Shell](/docs/usage-modes#interactive-shell)** | REPL with TAB completion | Learning, exploration |
| **[GitHub Actions](/docs/usage-modes#github-actions)** | Pre-built CI/CD action | GitHub workflows |
| **[Docker](/docs/usage-modes#docker)** | Containerized RAPS | Isolated environments |
| **[MCP Server](/docs/usage-modes#mcp-server)** | AI assistant integration | Claude, Cursor |

📖 See [Usage Modes](/docs/usage-modes) for detailed comparison and setup guides.

## Core Features

### 🔐 Authentication
- 2-legged OAuth (Client Credentials) for server-to-server operations
- 3-legged OAuth (Authorization Code) with browser login
- Secure token storage with automatic refresh

### 📦 Object Storage Service (OSS)
- Create, list, and delete buckets (multi-region support)
- Upload, download, and manage objects
- Resumable multipart uploads for large files
- Batch uploads with parallel processing

### 🔄 Model Derivative
- Translate CAD files to various formats (SVF2, OBJ, STL, STEP, etc.)
- Check translation status with polling
- Download derivatives

### 🏗️ Data Management
- Browse hubs, projects, folders, and items
- Create folders and manage versions
- Full BIM 360/ACC integration

### 🤖 MCP Server (v3.0.0+)
- AI Assistant Integration via Model Context Protocol
- 14+ tools for natural language APS operations
- Works with Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients

## Architecture

RAPS follows a **microkernel architecture** that separates core functionality from extended features:

- **Kernel**: Minimal trusted foundation (Auth, HTTP client, Configuration, Error handling)
- **Service Crates**: Independent modules for APS APIs (OSS, Derivative, Data Management, SSA)
- **Application Layer**: User interfaces (CLI, MCP Server, TUI) and extended features

See the [Architecture Guide](/docs/architecture) for detailed information.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install RAPS
cargo install raps

# Configure credentials
export APS_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
export APS_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"

# Test authentication
raps auth test

# Start using commands!
raps bucket list
```
